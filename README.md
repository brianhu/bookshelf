<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h3>

BookShelf is intended to utilise resources we have and lower the barrier of knowledge sharing.<br />

To make good use of our resources, we need to know what we have and how we are using them now. 
Imagine. If I know what I have in hands, when my friend need something and I have it, I could easily locate where it is and provide them with what they need. They don't need to get it themselves.
Imagine. If I know that I am not making good use of what I have, I can decide either to use it more or get rid of it and make better use of my limited space.</p>

Knowledge is one important thing that should be managed. If one could manage knowledge well, people could exchange what they have and share expertise and experience. The world should work better when it is easier to transfer knowledge. </p>

That is why BookShelf is built. It is a start for our vision, to make resources well utilised and make it easier for people to access knowledge.</p>


<h3 id="why">Why Using BookShelf?</h3>

What books are there on your bookshelf?<br />
Which books are recently read?<br />
How much time did you spend on each of your book?<br />
If you cannot, and you feel like you want to get to know your own bookshelf, BookShelf is here for you.</p>

<h3 id="what">What can BookShelf do?</h3>

BookShelf is an open source iOS app. Bookshelf helps users organise their collection of books and record how much time they have spent on a book, and the cost performance of a book. Users could have a good understanding of their own bookshelves and make brilliant decisions to take actions in the real world. The most updated version allows users to:
   + View their own book collection
   + View a book in the collection (including cost performance and reading records)
   + Manage their own book collection (add/modify/delete)
   + Add reading record of a book

<h3 id="futureworkitems">Future work items</h3>

Resource utilisation and knowledge sharing are goals with no limits. We would like to add more featurs, especially social interaction ones, in the future. Here are some we are working on:
   + Share a book via facebook
   + Lend/Borrow a book from a facebook friend
   + View the status of a book (on shelf or rented out)

We are also planning payment and logistics to facilitate users to rent our their books with a fee.
