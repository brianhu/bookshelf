Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted
document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
Markdown's syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML
filters -- including [Setext] [1] -- the single biggest source of
inspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text email.

<h3 id="why">Why Using BookShelf?</h3>

Markdown's syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a
format for *writing* for the web.

<h3 id="what">What can BookShelf do?</h3>

In HTML, there are two characters that demand special treatment: `<`
and `&`. Left angle brackets are used to start tags; ampersands are
used to denote HTML entities. If you want to use them as literal
characters, you must escape them as entities, e.g. `&lt;`, and
`&amp;`.

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated
by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a
blank line -- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered
blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.

Markdown supports two styles of headers, [Setext] [1] and [atx] [2].
